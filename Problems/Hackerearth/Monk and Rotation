Problem Statement: 
Monk loves to preform different operations on arrays, and so being the principal of Hackerearth School, he assigned a task to his new student Mishki. Mishki will be provided with an integer array A of size N and an integer K , where she needs to rotate the array in the right direction by K steps and then print the resultant array. As she is new to the school, please help her to complete the task.

Solution 1: 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int tests, n, k;
	cin >> tests;    //Reading input from STDIN
	if(tests<1) return 0;
	for ( int t = 0; t< tests; t++)
	{
		cin >> n; //n=5
		cin >> k; 
		long long int a[n],b[n] ;
    
    // If k=1,6 b = [4 0 1 2 3]
    // If k=2,7 b = [3 4 0 1 2]
    // If k=0,5 b = [0 1 2 3 4]
    // shifts k times to the right - hence add k to i, 
    // when i+k overflows the size n, use modulus to get the new position - (i + k) % n
		for (int i = 0; i<n; i++)
		{
			cin >> a[i];
			b[(i+k)%n] = a[i];
		}

		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			cout << b[i] << " ";
		}
		cout << endl;
	}
	
	
	//cout << "Input number is " << num << endl;	// Writing output to STDOUT
}

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: TBD
